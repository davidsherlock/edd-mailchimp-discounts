## [Easy Digital Downloads - MailChimp Discounts](https://sellcomet.com/downloads/mailchimp-discounts/)

MailChimp Discounts for Easy Digital Downloads allows you to easily reward discounts to WordPress for MailChimp subscribers, incentivising customers to join your mailing list and help grow your audience.

The generated discount codes are fully customizable, including the notification email sent to the customer upon successful submission. You can decide the discount amount, type, uses, expiration date, and minimum order threshold. Additionally, discounts will only be issued to new subscribers, not existing, and you can conditionally select which MailChimp list the user must sign up to before the discount is granted (useful for store owners with more than one sign-up form).

Custom MailChimp fields are also supported within the notification email, along with comprehensive discount details, helping you cater the discount message towards your audience.
